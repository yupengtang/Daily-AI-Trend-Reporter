ðŸ“‹ Summary: IGL-Nav introduces a novel approach to image-goal navigation by incrementally building a 3D Gaussian-based map of the environment as an agent explores. This method enables more accurate localization and efficient path planning toward visual goals, outperforming prior techniques in unfamiliar settings. The approach has practical implications for autonomous robots and embodied agents operating in complex, real-world environments where prior maps are unavailable.

**7. Learning an Efficient Multi-Turn Dialogue Evaluator from Multiple Judges**  
ðŸ”— [Read Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.00454)  
ðŸ“‹ Summary: The paper introduces a novel multi-turn dialogue evaluation model that learns from the diverse preferences of multiple human judges, improving both accuracy and efficiency over existing evaluators. By aggregating and modeling inter-annotator variability, the approach better captures nuanced conversational quality across turns. This innovation enables more reliable automatic assessment of dialogue systems, facilitating faster development and benchmarking in conversational AI applications.

**8. Investigating Hallucination in Conversations for Low Resource Languages**  
ðŸ”— [Read Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.22720)  
ðŸ“‹ Summary: This paper investigates the phenomenon of hallucinationâ€”when conversational AI systems generate factually incorrect or fabricated informationâ€”in low-resource languages. The authors introduce new benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored for these languages, and analyze the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Their work enables more reliable conversational AI for underserved linguistic communities, with practical applications in multilingual virtual assistants and customer support.

**9. 3D-R1: Enhancing Reasoning in 3D VLMs for Unified Scene Understanding**
