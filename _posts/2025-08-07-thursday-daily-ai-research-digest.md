ðŸ“‹ Summary: SEAgent introduces a self-evolving AI agent designed to autonomously learn and adapt to usersâ€™ computer usage patterns through continual experience. Its key innovation lies in integrating self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning to enable the agent to improve its assistance capabilities without manual intervention. This approach has practical applications in creating intelligent personal assistants that proactively optimize workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and personalize user experiences over time.

**3. Sotopia-RL: Reward Design for Social Intelligence**  
ðŸ”— [Read Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.03905)  
ðŸ“‹ Summary: Sotopia-RL introduces a novel reward design framework aimed at enhancing social intelligence in multi-agent reinforcement learning environments. The key innovation lies in crafting reward structures that promote socially intelligent behaviors, such as cooperation and negotiation, among agents. This approach has practical implications for developing AI systems capable of more effective and nuanced social interactions in applications like virtual assistants, collaborative robotics, and multi-agent simulations.

**4. Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens**  
ðŸ”— [Read Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.01191)  
ðŸ“‹ Summary: This paper investigates whether the impressive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) genuinely reflect reasoning skills or are artifacts of data distribution and training. The authors show that LLMsâ€™ CoT performance often stems from statistical patterns in the training data rather than true reasoning, challenging common assumptions about LLMsâ€™ reasoning capabilities. These findings suggest that future evaluation and development of LLMs should account for data distribution effects to ensure genuine reasoning, impacting how such models are assessed and deployed in reasoning-critical applications.

**5. Web-CogReasoner: Towards Knowledge-Induced Cognitive Reasoning for Web
  Agents**  
ðŸ”— [Read Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.01858)  
ðŸ“‹ Summary: Web-CogReasoner introduces a novel framework that integrates structured knowledge with cognitive reasoning capabilities for web agents, enabling them to perform more complex, context-aware decision-making on the web. The key innovation lies in combining symbolic knowledge bases with neural reasoning modules, allowing agents to understand, infer, and act upon web information more intelligently. This approach has practical applications in enhancing web search, recommendation systems, and automated web-based assistants by improving their ability to reason over heterogeneous web data.

**6. Sculptor: Empowering LLMs with Cognitive Agency via Active Context
  Management**  
ðŸ”— [Read Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.04664)  
ðŸ“‹ Summary: The paper introduces Sculptor, a framework that enhances large language models (LLMs) with cognitive agency by enabling them to actively manage and curate their own context during inference. The key innovation lies in allowing LLMs to dynamically select, retrieve, and organize relevant information, improving their ability to handle complex, multi-step tasks and adapt to evolving user needs. This approach has practical applications in autonomous agents, long-form reasoning, and personalized AI assistants, where effective context management is critical for performance and reliability.

**7. HPSv3: Towards Wide-Spectrum Human Preference Score**  
ðŸ”— [Read Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.03789)  
ðŸ“‹ Summary: HPSv3 introduces a novel, wide-spectrum Human Preference Score designed to more accurately quantify human preferences across diverse AI-generated content, surpassing previous benchmarks in both coverage and alignment with human judgments. The key innovation lies in its unified scoring framework, which leverages large-scale, multi-domain human feedback to train robust evaluators applicable to various modalities and tasks. This advancement enables more reliable evaluation and fine-tuning of generative AI systems, improving their alignment with real user expectations in applications such as conversational agents, content generation, and recommendation systems.

**8. Gaussian Variation Field Diffusion for High-fidelity Video-to-4D
  Synthesis**
