🎯 Topic: Diffusion Models for Real-time Inference  

📌 Summary:  
Diffusion models have revolutionized image generation, but their real-time deployment faces latency issues. Recent approaches integrate distillation, model compression, and latent-space diffusion to improve efficiency without major quality trade-offs. These advances make diffusion more practical for edge deployment and streaming applications.

🔑 Keywords: diffusion models, model compression, latency
