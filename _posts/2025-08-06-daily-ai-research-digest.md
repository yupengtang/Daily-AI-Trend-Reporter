**1. LongVie: Multimodal-Guided Controllable Ultra-Long Video Generation**  
🔗 [Read Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.03694)  
📋 Summary: LongVie introduces a novel framework for generating ultra-long videos guided by multimodal inputs (such as text, images, and audio), enabling fine-grained control over content, style, and narrative coherence across extended durations. The key innovation lies in its hierarchical architecture and control mechanisms, which maintain temporal consistency and allow user-driven customization throughout lengthy video sequences. This approach has significant practical applications in film production, virtual storytelling, simulation, and content creation, where generating coherent, high-quality long-form videos is essential.

  and Generation**  
🔗 [Read Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.03320)  
📋 Summary: Skywork UniPic introduces a unified autoregressive framework that handles both visual understanding (e.g., classification, detection) and image generation tasks within a single model architecture. By leveraging a shared modeling approach, UniPic achieves strong performance across diverse vision benchmarks, demonstrating versatility and efficiency. This unified model enables practical applications in scenarios requiring both image analysis and synthesis, such as interactive AI systems and multimodal content creation.

📋 Summary: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that integrates external tools to enhance deep search capabilities within code repositories. By allowing an RL agent to interact with and leverage specialized tools (e.g., code analyzers, documentation retrievers) during search, the approach significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of finding relevant code or information in large repositories. This method has practical applications in code search, automated software maintenance, and developer productivity tools.

**5. LiveMCPBench: Can Agents Navigate an Ocean of MCP Tools?**  
🔗 [Read Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.01780)  
📋 Summary: LiveMCPBench introduces a comprehensive benchmarking suite designed to evaluate the ability of autonomous agents to interact with and utilize a diverse array of Model Checking and Planning (MCP) tools. The key innovation is a unified, live environment that systematically tests agent adaptability and tool interoperability across real-world MCP scenarios. This benchmark enables more robust development and comparison of AI agents for automated verification and planning, with practical applications in software engineering, robotics, and complex system management.

**6. AlignGuard-LoRA: Alignment-Preserving Fine-Tuning via Fisher-Guided
  Decomposition and Riemannian-Geodesic Collision Regularization**  
🔗 [Read Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.02079)  
📋 Summary: AlignGuard-LoRA introduces a novel fine-tuning method for large language models that preserves alignment with original model behaviors. It achieves this by using Fisher-guided decomposition to identify and protect critical model directions during low-rank adaptation, and by applying Riemannian-geodesic collision regularization to prevent harmful parameter drift. This approach enables safer, more reliable adaptation of language models for downstream tasks without sacrificing alignment, with practical applications in responsible AI deployment and domain-specific customization.

**7. TRACEALIGN -- Tracing the Drift: Attributing Alignment Failures to
  Training-Time Belief Sources in LLMs**  
🔗 [Read Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.02063)  
📋 Summary: TRACEALIGN introduces a method to trace alignment failures in large language models (LLMs) back to specific training-time data sources that influenced the model's beliefs. By attributing misaligned outputs to their origins in the training corpus, TRACEALIGN enables more targeted debugging and refinement of LLM training data, improving model alignment and safety. This approach has practical applications in auditing, dataset curation, and enhancing the reliability of LLM deployments.
